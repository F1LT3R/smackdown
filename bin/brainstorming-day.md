**The Goal Of The Lightening Rounds**

The goal of the Lightening Rounds is to open up the sitecues® team to new creative ideas. These new ideas will then be evaluated and discussed at a later date (yet to be determined). Ideas that are discussed may later be prioritized and could possibly turn into _10%-Time_ programs or even main-line development initiatives.

**Note:** _Audio from the Lightening Rounds will be recorded and made available to the team on the day after the talks._

- **If you would like to present:** you must follow the Submission Guidelines below.

- **If you would like to attend:** the Lightening Rounds, you must agree to submit to the Lightening Round Terms below.

- **Presentation Order is random:** the presentation order will be picked at random using small JavaScript program. After each talk, and following random presenter will be chosen by the computer. _(The source-code will be made available before the event)._

The Lightening Round can be in the form of:

 - A Slides Presentation
 - An Open Discussion
 - A Tech Demo
 - Time For Questions & Feedback
 - Any mixture of the above

###Submission Guidelines

1. Your presentation must be on a subject of your choice.
2. Your presentation must relate to the sitecues® product or team.
3. You must submit a _100-200_ word Brief about your presentation by Friday the 14th of November _(1 week away)_. Send you submissions to [Howard Davidson](mailto:hdavidson@aisquared.com).
4. Your presentation must be 25 minutes long and no longer.
5. You will be ready to setup in 2.5 minutes and breakdown in 2.5 minutes.

###Lightening Round Terms

_**Do Not Interrupt The Presenters**_

These talks are short and the ideas being presented will be condensed. Do not interrupt the presenter while they are giving their presentationm unless they explicitly open the floor for feedback. The presenter may choose to request feedback from the group at any time.

_**Do Not Demand Feedback**_

If you are asking for feedback from the group, do not demand feedback: the ideas you are presenting may not be something the group has considered before; they may need time to think over the implications or the technical points of what you are presenting.

_**Do Not Distract People**_

Because it's just rude.


##Post-BrainStorming &gt; Plan Forming

After the Brainstorming Day, we will meet to discuss the ideas: where we may discuss topics such as:

- How do we prioritize the ideas presented in the Lightening Rounds?
- How many ideas can we move on at once?
- Which ideas do we move on first?
- Who is interested in which ideas?
- Etc.
